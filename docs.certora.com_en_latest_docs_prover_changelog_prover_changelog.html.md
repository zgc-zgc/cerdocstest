  * [feat] Solana jobs now support `multi_assert_check`. Each assertion in a rule is verified separately, enabling better counterexample coverage and a timeout mitigation strategy.
  * [feat] Solana jobs now support `rule_sanity basic`, which performs vacuity checks to help detect trivially true rules.

  * [feat] The new `--auto_dispatcher` flag enables the Prover to automatically resolve unresolved calls by looking for matching functions in the scene and invoking them. If no matching function is found, the call will still result in a havoc.


### [CLI](https://docs.certora.com/en/latest/docs/prover/changelog/prover_changelog.html#id76)[](https://docs.certora.com/en/latest/docs/prover/changelog/prover_changelog.html#cli "Link to this heading")
  * [feat] The new `--split_rules` flag allows users to specify rules that will run in separate instances, reducing the risk of timeouts. Each rule matching the provided patterns runs in its own job with dedicated resources, while all other rules execute in a separate job. The CLI provides a dashboard link to track the status of all generated jobs.

  * [feat] Certora’s Foundry Integration lets you run Foundry fuzz tests as formal verification tests. If you already use forge test, you can leverage this integration to formally verify your tests or find counterexamples where they fail. Unlike fuzzing, formal verification provides guarantees for all inputs, not just randomized ones. Note that this integration is in alpha version and requires some CVL configuration.

  * [feat] The Call Trace received a re-design. As part of the re-design, the Call Trace highlights values the Prover found to generate the counter example as gray boxes with tooltips that provides additional information of the semantics of the values. Alongside this change, we also updated the font of the Call Trace.
  * [feat] It’s now easier to navigate to the Call Trace for a rule as the rule tree automatically opens nodes that contain only a single child.
  * [feat] Within the Call Trace, we added support for assignments to and loads from Solidity variables, structs and arrays. For assignments to primitive types the Call Trace also displays the assigned value.
  * [feat] Prover flags listed in the configuration tab of the rule report now link to their documentation.

  * [feat] A function can be called on a CVL variable of type address directly. In the following rule, the function `balanceOf` will be called on all contracts that define `balanceOf`:


```
  env e;
  address a;
  assert a.balanceOf(e) > 0;

```
Copy to clipboard
If no contract with such a function exists, a `require(false)` will be inserted, which may cause a vacuity.
  * [feat] The Prover now supports verifying code called via proxy contracts. You can specify `extension_contracts` in the `.conf` file to define which contracts are being delegate-called by the proxy.
  * [bugfix] The `--rule` filtering now applies also to built-in rules.

  * [feat] `prover_args` will now be validated locally before submitting the job to the cloud.
  * [deprecation] The `typechecker_args` option has been removed. Use the new Python CLI flag `--allow_solidity_calls_in_quantifiers` to allow Solidity calls in quantifiers.
  * [deprecation] The `--prover_args` flag `-adaptiveSolverConfig false` was deprecated. The flag was mainly used in combination with `-smt_useNIA` true to run NIA solvers only. Instead, use: `--prover_args "-backendStrategy singleRace -smt_useLIA false -smt_useNIA true"`.

  * [feat] Additional jump-to-source buttons were added to the Global Notifications, and some existing buttons were corrected. Specifically, buttons for these types of warnings were targeted: PTA failures, optimistic summary fallback fails, `InternalFuncMiss`, storage analysis failures, memory partitioning failures, and `StorageSplitter`.
  * [feat] Rule progress indicator: The progress of individual rules will be displayed in the tree view. Each node in the rule tree shows how many children have been completed already.

  * [feat] Functions can now be called on address-typed variables, allowing methods to dispatch on all contracts that implement the specified function.
  * [feat] Added a new `ASSERT_FALSE` summary type to assert that a function call to the summarized function should never occur.
  * [feat] Introduced new syntax for summarizing unresolved calls with dispatch lists, offering more precise control over which functions are inlined for unresolved calls. The old syntax remains available but now triggers a deprecation warning.
  * [feat] Added `nativeCodesize`, enabling direct access to the result of the `extcodesize` instruction from CVL. It functions similarly to `nativeBalances` in terms of blockchain state comparison and manipulation.
  * [bugfix] Hooks are no longer inlined on the `reset_storage` command. This change may affect “induction base” cases for invariant rules that previously relied on implicit hook inlining.
  * [bugfix] Explicit casting to `mathint` is no longer required when comparing the result of an arithmetic operation with a non-`mathint` value. Non-`mathint` values are now implicitly cast to `mathint`.

  * [bugfix] Make builtin sanity rule also check auto-generated assertions such as unwinding loop unroll assertions.
  * [feat] `DISPATCHER(true)` summaries will hard fail on type checking if there is no method in the scene that should be dispatched to.
  * [feat] Adding a warning when a contract alias conflicts with a contract in the scene.
  * [feat] View functions of contracts _other_ than the current contract are now also excluded when checking invariants.
  * [feat] It’s now possible to compare strings and bytes natively in CVL.
  * [feat] The dispatcher list summary now will also inline the fallback handler when using the `Contract._` syntax.
  * [feat] Transient storage support in invariants.
  * [feat] It’s now possible to also write CVL summaries that include structs.
  * [syntax check] The usage of the keyword `lastReverted` led to incorrect specifications in cases when the last call was not using the `@withrevert` syntax. During type checking, the CVL parser will now fail and report an error.
  * [feat] The dispatcher summary `DISPATCHER(false|true)` has been enhanced to also include fallbacks.
  * [feature] There are two new keywords `strong` and `weak` as prefix for `invariant`. A `strong invariant` is a regular `invariant` that will be additionally `asserted` before a havoc’d external unresolved call and `assumed` afterwards. `weak invariant` is an alias for `invariant` explicitly stating that the `invariant` will only hold pre- and post-method execution.
  * [feature] It’s now possible to write rules for Solidity functions whose name matches a CVL keyword.

  * [feature] Improved display of ghost variable reads in the call trace.

  * Making access of user-defined-types (enums, structs, user-defined type values) in Solidity consistent, whether those types are declared in a contract or outside of a contract. Specifically, for a user-defined type that’s declared in a contract, the access to it in a spec file is `DeclaringContract.TypeName`. For top-level user-defined types (declared outside of any contract/library) the access is using the using contract `UsingContract.TypeName`.
